        "summary": "Monster Hunter Wilds is a 2025 action role-playing game developed and published by Capcom. A successor to Monster Hunter: World (2018), the game released worldwide for Windows, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and Series S, with support for cross-platform play, on February 28, 2025.\n\nAs with other Monster Hunter games, Wilds has the player control a Hunter that is part of a guild assigned to explore the Forbidden Lands, a nearly uninhabitable area with multiple biomes and dangerous storms. During their exploration, the Hunter must fight large monsters that threaten their group, either by killing or capturing them. The Hunter then can collect resources from their victories, as well as from gathering in the field, to synthesize new weapons and armor with better attributes that allows the Hunter to fight stronger monsters. The player has an option of using fourteen different weapon types in combat, each with different combat maneuvers. New to Wilds is the ability to carry up to two weapons into the field using their mounted bird-like Seikrets to swap gear, the ability to set up pop-up camps within the game's open world to create a more seamless hunting experience, and a wound system that allows the player to target weak points on a monster to inflict more damage.\n\nWithin three days of release, Wilds sold more than 8 million copies, making it Capcom's fastest-selling game to date.",
